## Typescript Data Structure Study

This repository aims to implement the most common and most used data strucutures in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language. Each data structure is also associated to a test file that can be used to test its behaviour.

As a project requirement, all data structures are implemented using generics to guarantee flexibility across data types.
