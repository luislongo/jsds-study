## Typescript Data Structure Study

This repository aims to implement the most common and most used data structures in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language. Each data structure is also associated to a test file that can be used to test its behaviour.

As a project requirement, all data structures are implemented using generics to guarantee flexibility across data types. The project also implements algorithms related to these structures, such as BFS and DFS for trees and graphs.

### Implemented Data Structures
